<h2>This easy roasted broccoli is easy to make and will satisfy even the pickiest eaters. </h2>
<p>Roasted broccoli is easy to make and so much more flavorsome than boiled. My favorite part is the roasted sliced stem pieces.</p>

<h2>Here are the ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>14 ounces of broccoli</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<h2>Here are the steps to make your roasted broccoli:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Cut broccoli florets from the stalk. Peel the stalk and slice into 1/4-inch slices. Mix florets and stem pieces with olive oil in a bowl and transfer to a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Roast in the preheated oven until broccoli is tender and lightly browned, about 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
</ol>
